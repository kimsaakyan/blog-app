# blog-app
My blog application is a convenient platform for creating, viewing, and managing blogs. It's developed using React and React Router for routing, and it utilizes the Tailwind CSS library for a beautiful and modern design.

The application offers the following features:

Blog Posting: Create your own blogs with titles, descriptions, and hashtags.
Commenting on Posts: Leave comments on blogs and engage in discussions with other users.
Archiving: Archive blogs to save them for future reference.
Deletion and Editing: Delete or edit your blogs at any time.
Likes: Like your favorite blogs and keep track of their popularity.
The application has several sections, including 'Home' for viewing the latest blogs, 'Overview' for reviewing all blogs, and 'Archive' for accessing archived posts.

We use Redux Toolkit for state management, providing seamless data control. 

**Note: My project is located on the `main` branch. Make sure you are on the `main` branch.**
